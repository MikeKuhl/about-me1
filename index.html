        <p>
          As a child, I wanted to make lots of money, so that I could travel the
          world. I’ve traveled a bit but wanted more. I knew that you needed
          money to travel so that’s what I wanted but didn’t really understand
          how to get it.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a teen, I wanted to do something that was high tech, so that I
          could be challenged mentally. I was one of those teens that wouldn’t
          do any of the homework but ace the test. I didn’t feel challenged, so
          I put in minimal effort. This is probably why I didn’t care to go to
          college and instead joined the Army as a Signals Intelligence Analyst.

        <p class="bullet">Professional Life</p>

        <p>
          As a young Soldier, I wanted to be involved with high profile
          projects, so that I could be part of the excitement. I was the guy who
          bounced around different projects because that was the big thing at
          that moment. I was the team lead for the Surface-to-Surface Missile
          (SSM) team, team lead on the Saddam Fedayeen Militia team, and a team
          member on the Iranians in Iraq team. The excitement was always high
          and that’s what I was after.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a senior Soldier, I wanted serenity, so that I could do my job and
          help those who needed it. I got tired of the random stress that the
          Army felt was necessary. For periods of time, I had serenity and I was
          so much more productive that I always had time to help others with
          their projects. As with most things in the Army, those times ebbed and
          flowed with the current situation of the unit.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a civilian again, I want to be part of the tech work force, so that
          I can that challenge again and have a professional purpose again.
          After 20 years in the Army, things have obviously changed and I’m now
          playing catchup. I’ve always had interest in coding but didn’t know
          where to start. When I heard about Code Fellows, I was a little
          skeptical. Now that I’m in it, I’m embracing the challenge and want to
          keep going and push myself to the next level and then the next all the
          way to the top.
